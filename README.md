# Savestate
Mod for the game "Starsand" which just came out on steam in early access.
## What does it do?
Gives you the ability to have multiple savestates.

It replaces the functionality of the "Load Game" button in the main menu bringing you to a "special" world where you will find one stone statue for each savegame you have.
Standing beside that statue for 5 seconds will load the corresponding savestate.
Once the savestate is loaded you can play normally and also save as usually. The data will be stored in the corresponding save file which you can find in `C:\Users\USER\AppData\LocalLow\Tunnel Vision Studio\Starsand\`

## How does it work?
### Using a Mod Manager
Install either [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) and install the mod from there.
### Manual Installation
You can follow the steps in the [BepInEx Docs](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) to setup BepInEx and then download [the release](https://github.com/sp00ktober/SaveState/releases) and copy it into your plugins folder.
